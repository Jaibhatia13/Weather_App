I developed a weather application that provides real-time weather updates for cities across India. 
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed a user-friendly interface that displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
The app fetches accurate and up-to-date data from a reliable weather API, ensuring users receive the most recent information. 
This project helped me enhance my skills in web development and API integration while addressing a practical need for timely weather updates.
